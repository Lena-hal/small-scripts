# Reddit Account Verification Script

This script is designed to verify a Reddit account's username and age, as well as its karma score, to ensure that it meets certain requirements before allowing access to Discord servers associated with a subreddit.

To use this script, you will need to have Python 3 and PRAW library installed on your machine. You can run the script from the command line by typing "python account_verification.py" and following the prompts.

The script contains 1 function that needs you to enter a Reddit username. It will then check whether that username is in use and whether the account associated with that username is at least one month old and has a karma score of 50 or higher. If the account meets these criteria, the script will return True/False

This script is intended to be used in conjunction with Discord servers associated with a subreddit to ensure that only Reddit users are able to access the server. It is important to note that this script is not foolproof and should be used in conjunction with other verification methods to ensure the security of the Discord server.

If you have any questions or encounter any issues while using this script, please contact the developer for assistance.
